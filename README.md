# Flex Playground

This is an interactive, visual tool designed to help developers learn, build, and experiment with CSS Flexbox layouts. You can manipulate various flex container and item properties through a user-friendly interface and see the changes reflected in a live preview.

The application also generates the corresponding code in four different formats:
- Plain CSS
- React Inline Styles
- Tailwind CSS Classes
- A complete React Component

This allows you to quickly grab the code you need for your own projects.
